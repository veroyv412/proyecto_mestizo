Make your site load faster with file compression, minification and browser caching – because when it comes to pagespeed, every millisecond counts!


== Description ==

<strong>Hummingbird</strong> zips through your site and finds new ways to boost page speed with fine-tuned controls over <strong>file compression</strong>, <strong>minification</strong> and <strong>browser caching</strong>. Load your pages quicker and score higher on <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/">Google PageSpeed Insights</a> with Hummingbird site optimization.

= Features Available in Hummingbird Include: =

* Performance Reports - Pro tips for running your site at super speed
* Minification - Position, minify and combine files for top performance
* Browser Caching - Reward repeat visitors with faster load times
* GZIP Compression - Blazing fast HTML, JavaScript, and stylesheet transfer


= Scans and Recommendations =

Hummingbird will scan your site, find files that are slowing it down and provide tips and fixes for making your site run at top speed.

Hummingbird even has one-click improvements for quickly optimizing performance.

★★★★★ <br>
“Hummingbird is so easy to use. I thought it wouldn't change my speed much because I already made improvements. I ran the scan, it gave me recommendations, I pushed a button to apply them and it made my site even faster!” - <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/profile/juancamilobuitrago">Camilo</a>

★★★★★ <br>
“Hummingbird took me from 32 to 84 on Google page speed plus made my site 50% faster on GTmetrix!” - <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/profile/nicolastergiopoulos">Nicolas</a>

= Minification =

Did you know that the more files you add to your site’s the header, the slower it will load? With Hummingbird, you can easily customize the load position of your files to increase your page speed.

Quickly reorder, compress and reposition files with Hummingbird’s minification feature. But play carefully – minification is a powerful tool (though if you need it, you can reset any changes you make in one click).

= Transfer Data at Top Speed with GZIP =

Hummingbird has GZIP powers to make sharing your site more efficient.
Sending zipped files is faster and can save you money on hosting. And don’t worry about setup, send Hummingbird instructions with the click of a button and she’ll handle the rest.

= Browser Cache =

Make your site load even faster for returning visitors. Browser caching stores content in your visitor’s browser so they don't have to download things twice.

= Built-in Cloudflare Integration =

Hummingbird can be used to control your <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/">CloudFlare</a> browser cache settings as well! Simply add your CloudFlare API details and configure away.

Hummingbird is a one of a kind WordPress performance optimization plugin that can make your site run at superspeed, for free!

However, if you'd like automated scanning, uptime monitoring, enhanced minify compression with up to 2x the regular optimization, CDN hosted minification and Smush Pro image optimization you can always take the next step with a <a href="https://premium.wpmudev.org/">WPMU DEV Membership.</a>



== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I need Hummingbird if I already have WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache? =

Yes! If you already use WP Rocket or W3 Total Cache the special monitoring tools Hummingbird offers makes it worth it. To ensure compatibility only activate overlapping features in one of the plugins.

= Does Hummingbird work with CloudFlare? =

Yes! Hummingbird is built to take full advantage of CloudFlare features. Just plug in your API to get started.

= Does Hummingbird work with plugins like WP Super Cache, Batcache or the full page caching feature my Managed WordPress host offers? =

Yes! Plugins like WP Super Cache and Batcache and Managed WordPress Hosting that offer full page only HTML caching are actually recommended by Hummingbird to give your users the fastest browsing experience possible for your site.

= Does Hummingbird work with WooCommerce? =

Yes! Hummingbird only caches browser assets, like images, stylesheets & scripts (not cookies). Because we leave full page caching to dedicated plugins, Hummingbird works great with ecommerce plugins like WooCommerce and MarketPress.

= Somebody help! I turned on Minification and it broke my site!? =

Minification is a great way to speed up your site but moving combining and rearranging files can also mess with styling and break functionality. We recommend making incremental changes and testing your site as you go so you can undo the changes if something breaks. And remember, don’t panic. If something goes wrong you can start over with the click of a button :)
